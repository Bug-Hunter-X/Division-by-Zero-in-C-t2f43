This repository contains a simple C program that demonstrates a common runtime error: division by zero.  The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to divide an integer by zero. This will lead to undefined behavior, most likely resulting in a segmentation fault or program crash. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version of the code that handles potential division by zero scenarios using an if statement to check the divisor before performing the division.
